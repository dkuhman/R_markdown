# Using R Markdown to Generate HTML Files
This repository hosts R scripts that provide examples for R markdown and R shiny apps.

## Static HTML Generator
`static_html_markup.Rmd`: This R Markdown script provides a simple example of a static HTML generator. It includes simple text markup, examples of R chunks that load data, tidy data, and plot data (the plot is then included in the HTML output). The script uses the data file `skater_stats.csv` and produces `static_html_markup.html`.

## Shniy Apps for Interactive HTML
`shiny_html_markup.Rmd`: This R Markdown Shiny App provides a simple example of an interactive HTML file. It includes simple text markup, examples of R chunks that load data, tidy data, provide user interactivity (e.g., dropdown list selections), and plot data. The script uses the data file `skater_stats.csv` and produces `shiny_html_markup.html`.
